# PrimeNumbers

> Speedup and Efficiency calculation


## Objective 

The objective is to obtain the Speedup and the efficiency, 
executing the code from 1 to 16 threads, verifying if the 
numbers are prime or not from 2 to 100,000,000


## Observation For Results

* Bug: There is an error that causes tasks already carried 
out to be repeated multiple times.
* Collateral: due to the bug I have not been able to make 
the graphics correctly.
* Observation: do not consider tables with results this 28-10
